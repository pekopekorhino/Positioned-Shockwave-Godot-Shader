# Positioned-Shockwave-Godot-Shader

Based on the shockwave shader tutorial by Nolkaloid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHdglr35pk

The shader itself is the same, but now you can pass the [global position of the object - global position of the camera] to the global_position uniform of the shader to make the shockwave emit from the object.

Video on the shader:
